Hello! My name is Shadab Khan, and I am a researcher working at the intersection of ML, CV and Medical Imaging at [Inception Institute of AI][IIAI] in Abu Dhabi. 

Previously, I completed my postdoctoral fellowship at [Harvard Med/BCH](https://crl.med.harvard.edu) working with Prof. [Ali Gholipour](https://imagine.med.harvard.edu), where I developed methods for [fetal brain diffusion tensor imaging and atlas construction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918307286), and [group analysis of fetal brains from a congenital heart disease (CHD) cohort](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00931-1_4). I obtained my Ph.D. in Engineering Sciences from [Thayer School of Engineering](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu) at [Dartmouth College](dartmouth.edu) in June 2016. During my Ph.D., I was advised by Prof. [Ryan Halter](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/faculty/ryan-halter/) at [The Center for Clinical Applications of Bioimpedance](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/bioimpedance/). At Dartmouth, I was fortunate to be a recipient of the [Neukom Graduate Fellowship](http://neukom.dartmouth.edu/programs/2015grad_fellows.html), and [Outstanding Graduate Research in Computational Sciences](https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/funding/students/undergraduate-graduate-research-prizes) award. For my Ph.D. work, I used an [electrical impedance tomography system](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6948344) that I developed to spectroscopically analyze the [impedance contrast between benign and cancerous prostatic tissues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5209243/). Additionally, I developed computer vision tools to assist an image-guided cancer resection procedure during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

During 2006-2010, I was an undergraduate student at [Manipal Academy of Higher Education](www.manipal.edu) in India, where I obtained a B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering. I did my Bachelors' thesis research work at [Institute for Sytems and Robotics](http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt), in Lisbon, Portugal, with Prof. [Joao Sanches](http://www.isr.ist.utl.pt/~jmrs) and Prof. [Rodrigo Ventura](http://users2.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~yoda/newhome/) in the area of [computational pathology](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5512622).
